# Language-Translator-App-in-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Text-to-Speech-Convertor
I created it using HTML CSS & JavaScript.It also It also converts enterds txt to speech and translated sppech to text and vice-versa<br>
I used a free API to convert user-entered text into different languages.
This API is used only to convert text into other languages. Other things such as copying translated text and converting text to speech are done with JavaScript.
